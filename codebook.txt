Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals 
tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant 
rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter 
with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated
into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were 
calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate 
frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.Notes: 

Finally, all measurements were averaged by subject and activity to obtain the final columns as in the data set:
Subject - An identifier for each person performing in the study. Ranges from 1 - 30
Activity - 1 of 6 Activites performed from the set:
	1 WALKING
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING
